1. I added a new field to display separate text on homepage for posts.But it didn't work.It took me around 2 hours to figure out how to do that.I searched on stackoverflow and found makemigrations command.Then when I finally did it. There was some problem with migrations.I changed the default text for new field at it will always take the old field. There were minimal posts so I deleted them and created new ones.Although for new ones the default field was changed to the one I wanted to. Turned out I had to change them manually. So, deleting was not a bad option too.
